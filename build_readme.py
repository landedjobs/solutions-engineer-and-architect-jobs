Self-contained README builder for a single job-list repo.

Each job-list repo ships a copy of THIS file plus:
  - meta.json   {"role": "...", "title": "..."}
  - jobs.json   [ {company, role, location, type, posted, url, ...}, ... ]

Run inside the repo (this is what the GitHub Action calls):
    python3 build_readme.py

Wire `fetch_jobs()` to your real data source to make the repo auto-update.

## How to actually land one

Applying cold is the slow path — these roles usually go to people who get **referred**. With {BRAND} you can scout every opening, find a connection at the company and auto-draft a referral message, prep with company-specific mock interviews, and track every application.
